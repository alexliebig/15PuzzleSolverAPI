The purpose of this project was to play around with a containerized version of a 15 puzzle solver to make it into an API. The original C++ program used the A* search algorithm and the Manhatten distances
to create the 15 puzzle game/solver. Using the API, the user can input a message string that parses the message (which should be the actual unsolved 15 puzzle) into the program, solves it, then returns
another message string that informs the user the steps needed to solve the 15 puzzle. This is still being developed.
